Job matching management tool

A fully featured, entirely custom coded Php/MySql web application created to manage frontoffice/backoffice recruitment processes based on CV/job vacancy profile matching.

The application:

- collects data from jobseekers and makes them available as a printable Europass CV;
- collects data from employers/job vacancies;
- finds the best matches CV/job vacancy;
- allows 4 classes of backoffice users to interact, communicate and keep track of the status of each match;
- features a comprehensive usage statistic tool for monitoring purposes;
- does much more than this ;)

The application was developed following OWASP safe code development/deployment practices.

Installation should be straightforward, just look for configuration files in the  /common directory and create system administrators pointing to the /access/createadmin.php (file not protected and not referenced by any script)
